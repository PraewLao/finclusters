Where:
- Ri = Return of the individual stock
- Rf = Risk-free rate
- RMKT = Return of the overall market
- Î²MKT = Sensitivity of stock return to the market return
- Î²SMB = Sensitivity to the size factor (Small minus Big)
- Î²HML = Sensitivity to the value factor (High minus Low book-to-market)
- Î²MOM = Sensitivity to the momentum factor
- Îµ = Idiosyncratic risk (firm-specific return variation unexplained by the factors)

We evaluate model performance using RMSE and MAE, and select the best predictive model for each GICS sector:

The app retrieves the default risk-free rate from Yahoo Finance in real-time, specifically using the 10-Year Treasury Yield, ticker symbol **`^TNX`**.  
If live data is unavailable, a fallback default rate of **4.0%** is applied to ensure continuity.

Users have the flexibility to manually adjust the risk-free rate if they believe an alternative assumption is more appropriate for their analysis.  
Upon changing the input, the app dynamically recalculates expected returns across all predictive models to reflect the updated assumptions.

Moreover, users can toggle between using **historical market excess returns** and **forward-looking risk premium estimates** sourced from [NYU Stern](https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/), providing additional flexibility in modeling expected returns.

The app projects potential future stock prices based on three forecasting methods.

Using the expected return derived from the best-fit capital pricing model (CAPM, Fama-French 3-Factor, or Carhart 4-Factor), we estimate the intrinsic value of the stock based on a simplified Gordon Growth framework.  
Specifically, if the company's forward EPS (Earnings Per Share) is available, and the model-implied expected return exceeds a 3% assumed terminal growth rate, the stock price is estimated as:

Building on the financial peer cluster analysis, we also forecast a range of possible stock prices based on the minimum and maximum expected returns observed among a company's peers.
