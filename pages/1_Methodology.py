We use **K-Means Clustering** to group companies based on similar **financial profiles**.  
The clustering models are **industry-specific**, with separate models trained for:
- Healthcare (GICS 35): The training model was developed in [this Colab notebook](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uGNFtpK5DD30P3GPYlD-GmGnO6TvwGBd?usp=share_link).
- Consumer Discretionary (GICS 25): The training model was developed in [this Colab notebook](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1PWsaECx9pbb4ruzWR5-gOj2IYSFUcOJW?usp=share_link).
- Information Technology (GICS 45): The training model was developed in [this Colab notebook](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15NKTZJ-nmJHGjEi9op1NyURigUFiRsND?usp=share_link).

The **K-Means Algorithm** partitions companies into **k clusters** by minimizing the sum of squared distances between points and their assigned cluster centroids.

Typical values:
- Healthcare: 6 clusters
- Consumer Discretionary: 7 clusters
- Information Technology: 5 clusters

We use historical stock return and factor data covering **January 2000 to December 2024**.

The dataset is split into training and testing sets based on a fixed date:
- **Training set**: January 2000 â€“ December 2018 (~76% of the data)
- **Testing set**: January 2019 â€“ December 2024 (~24% of the data)

This split ensures that the model is trained on historical periods and evaluated on more recent, unseen data.

To calculate and showcase the predicted expected return for a selected stock, the app selects the most precise model for each industry, retrieves the beta coefficients from the regression results, and pulls the default risk-free rate from Yahoo Finance in real-time, specifically using the 10-Year Treasury Yield, ticker symbol **`^TNX`**. If live data is unavailable, a fallback default rate of **4.0%** is applied to ensure continuity.

Users have the flexibility to manually adjust the risk-free rate if they believe an alternative assumption is more appropriate for their analysis.  
Upon changing the input, the app dynamically recalculates expected returns across all predictive models to reflect the updated assumptions.

Moreover, users can toggle between using historical market excess returns and forward-looking risk premium estimates sourced from [NYU Stern](https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/), providing additional flexibility in modeling expected returns.
