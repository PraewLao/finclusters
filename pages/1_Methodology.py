We evaluate model performance using RMSE and MAE, and select the best predictive model for each GICS sector:
- CAPM for Healthcare
- Fama-French 3-Factor for Consumer Discretionary
- CAPM for Information Technology

st.markdown("""
The app projects potential future stock prices based on three forecasting methods.  
Each method leverages the expected returns estimated earlier and combines them with forward-looking earnings data retrieved from Yahoo Finance.  
This multi-approach framework provides users with a more comprehensive view of price potential under different assumptions.

st.markdown("#### Model-Based Forecast")
st.markdown("""
Using the expected return derived from the best-fit capital pricing model (CAPM, Fama-French 3-Factor, or Carhart 4-Factor), we estimate the intrinsic value of the stock based on a simplified Gordon Growth framework.  
Specifically, if the company's forward EPS (Earnings Per Share) is available, and the model-implied expected return exceeds a 3% assumed terminal growth rate, the stock price is estimated as:
""")
st.latex(r"\text{Model-Based Price} = \frac{\text{Forward EPS}}{\text{Expected Return} - \text{Terminal Growth}}")

This approach anchors the valuation on fundamental earnings expectations adjusted for sector-specific risk-return profiles.

st.markdown("#### Peer-Based Forecast Range")
st.markdown("""
Building on the financial peer cluster analysis, we also forecast a range of possible stock prices based on the minimum and maximum expected returns observed among a company's peers.  
If both the peer minimum and maximum expected returns exceed the 3% terminal growth assumption, peer-based price forecasts are calculated as:

st.latex(r"\text{Peer Price Range} = \left[ \frac{\text{Forward EPS}}{\text{Peer Max Return} - \text{Terminal Growth}},\quad \frac{\text{Forward EPS}}{\text{Peer Min Return} - \text{Terminal Growth}} \right]")

This range offers a benchmark comparison, showing how a company's valuation may vary relative to similar companies' risk-return expectations.

Lastly, we incorporate market consensus by estimating a stock price based on forward P/E ratios provided by analysts on Yahoo Finance.  
The analyst forecast price is computed by simply multiplying the forward P/E by the forward EPS:
